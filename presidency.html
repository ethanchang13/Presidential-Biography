          <h2>The New Frontier</h2>
          <p>
            When John F. Kennedy took office on January 20, 1961, he became the
            youngest elected president at age 43 and the first Catholic
            president in American history. In his inaugural address, he famously
            called on Americans to "ask not what your country can do for you â€”
            ask what you can do for your country."
          </p>
          <p>
            Kennedy's administration, which he termed the "New Frontier," aimed
            to tackle both domestic and international challenges. Though his
            presidency lasted just 1,036 days before his assassination, Kennedy
            managed to leave a lasting impact on American politics, culture, and
            foreign policy.

                <p>
                  In April 1961, Kennedy authorized a CIA-backed invasion of
                  Cuba by Cuban exiles, aiming to overthrow Fidel Castro's
                  communist government. The invasion failed disastrously, with

                  for the new administration.

                  During Kennedy's presidency, U.S. involvement in Vietnam
                  increased, with the number of military advisors rising from
                  about 900 to over 16,000. Kennedy's exact intentions regarding
                  Vietnam remain debated, as his assassination came before any
                  definitive policy direction was established.

            <p>
              On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated while
              riding in a motorcade through Dallas, Texas. He was shot by Lee
              Harvey Oswald and pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital.
              The tragic event stunned the nation and the world, leaving an
              indelible mark on American history.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kennedy's legacy extends far beyond his brief presidency. His
              vision for space exploration led to the Apollo moon landings, his
              commitment to civil rights paved the way for landmark legislation,
              and his handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis demonstrated
              diplomatic skill in avoiding nuclear conflict.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps most importantly, Kennedy inspired a generation with his
              calls to public service and his vision of America as a force for
              good in the world. As he said in his inaugural address, "The
              energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor
              will light our country and all who serve itâ€”and the glow from that
              fire can truly light the world."
